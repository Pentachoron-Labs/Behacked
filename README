1. INTRODUCTION

This is Behacked. It's like Bejeweled, but it uses ncurses. The other
difference is that instead of trying to get a row of three the goal is
to get a group of four connected gems.

Controls are like so:

arrow keys / hjkl - move
space - select a gem for swapping

Move to a gem, press space, move to an adjacent gem, press space
again; if you can swap them and create a group of four, then you will
earn points. Simple as that.

There are a couple other keys that only exist for debugging
purposes. If you don't want these you should probably turn DEBUG off.

2. COMPILING

It's one C file; you can figure out how you want to compile it ;-)

(but `gcc behacked.c -o behacked -lncurses` should probably work for
most people)

3. LICENSE

Behacked is public domain. Do whatever you like with it. It'd be nice
if you credit the original source, though.
